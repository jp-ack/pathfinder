# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm, an efficient algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points. The program allows users to create barriers and set start and end points interactively.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid:** Create barriers, set start and end points.
- **Visualization:** Watch the A* algorithm in action as it explores paths.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Reset the grid or start a new pathfinding session.

## How It Works
1. **Start and End Points:**
   - Left-click to place the start (orange) and end (turquoise) points.
2. **Barriers:**
   - Left-click on additional cells to create barriers (black).
   - Right-click on a cell to remove a barrier or reset a point.
3. **Run the Algorithm:**
   - Press the `Space` key to start the A* visualization.
   - The algorithm will find and display the shortest path (purple) if one exists.
4. **Reset:**
   - Press `C` to clear the grid and start fresh.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jp-ack/pathfinder
